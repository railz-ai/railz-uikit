# Helpers

Helpers are simple, single-purpose functions and mixins to make it easier for you to access your design tokens and components. They are not strictly required, but should improve the ergonomics of building your interface. They include built in error messaging and documentation, that updates dynamically, to help you make sure you're using the correct design tokens.

## Mixins

The `_mixins.scss` file includes a handfull of general purpose mixins, that provide shortcuts to common CSS patterns.
