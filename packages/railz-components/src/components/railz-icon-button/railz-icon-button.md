# Icon Buttons

Occaisionally, the interface design calls for a simple interactive icon. Rather than just adding an `onClick` event to an `railz-icon` component,
it is strongly recommended to use the `railz-icon-button` component. This component has all of the affordances of a normal button - like focus, disabled, and
loading states - that are required for creating a rich user experience.
